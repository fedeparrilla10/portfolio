      <p>
        I'm a developer who embarked on their journey in October 2023 as a
        self-taught enthusiast. I later expanded my knowledge by completing a
        bootcamp at UpgradeHub, with a specific focus on front-end development.
        During my initial professional experience, I had the opportunity to work
        with NextJS and also gained valuable experience with PHP and its Laravel
        framework. This exposure enabled me to grasp the inner workings of
        backend development and databases, which further enriched my learning
        experience. Dedication and enthusiasm have been with me from the
        beginning, and I view them as my core foundations.
