    Hi! 👋🏻 I'm

    <p>
      I'm a developer who embarked on their journey in October 2022 as a
      self-taught enthusiast. I later expanded my knowledge by completing a
      bootcamp at UpgradeHub, with a specific focus on front-end development.
      Dedication and enthusiasm have been with me from the beginning, and I view
      them as my core foundations.
